I'm gonna ask you two different questions:

1. Tell me what's your name
2. Tell me "what's your name"

Until now, we learned how to tell the computer to evaluate expressions, like this:

~~~klipse
(+ 3 4)
~~~

If we want the computer to display expressions exactly as they are, we use the `quote` operation, like this:

~~~klipse
(quote (+ 3 4))
~~~


The computer displays only the result of the evaluation of `(* 7 8)`.
