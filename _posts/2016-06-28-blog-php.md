This blog post is about to show a new way of blogging about `PHP`.

Look at a typical blog post about `PHP`: The post usually presents a couple of code snippets. As I see it, there are two pains with code snippets:

1. they contain the input and the output but not the actual evaluation of the input
2. it's impossible for the reader to modify the output

# Alan Kay's vision

For Alan Kay, evaluation and interactivity should be available everywhere in the web:

>Question: Well, look at Wikipedia â€” it's a tremendous collaboration.

>Alan Kay: It is, but go to the article on [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)), can you write and execute Logo programs? Are there examples? No. The Wikipedia people didn't even imagine that, in spite of the fact that they're on a computer.

Here is the [full interview of Alan Kay](http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/interview-with-alan-kay/240003442?pgno=2){:target="_blank"}. (Thanks [@fasihsignal](https://twitter.com/fasihsignal) for bringing this quote to our awareness.)

# The klipse plugin

The klipse plugin is a small step toward Alan Kay's vision: it is a `javascript` tag that transforms static `PHP` code snippets of an html page to live and interactive snippets:

1. **Live**: The code is executed in your browser
2. **Interactive**: You can modify the code and it is evaluated as you type

Klipse is on [gihtub](https://github.com/viebel/klipse): it is written in `clojurescript`, uses [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) for text editing, and [Uniter](https://asmblah.github.io/uniter/) for `PHP` evaluation inside the browser. 

> No server side is involved at all!


# Klipsify a PHP code snippet

Let's have on this page a static `PHP` code snippet with `print "Hello". " World!";`:

~~~php
<?php
print "Hello". "". "World!";
//Hello World!
?>
~~~

(This blog is written with `jekyll`: the `kramdown` plugin helps a lot in beautifying the code snippets.)

And now, we are going to **klipsify** this code snippet:

~~~klipse-eval-php
print "Hello". " World!";
~~~

Feel free to edit the code above: it's interactive => it evaluates as you type.

All I had to do in order to **klipsify** my code snippet, was to set the `language-klipse-eval-php` class (configurable) to the appropriate html element.

(Also, for convenience, we have removed the need for `<?php`.)

See it by yourself: here is the source of this page:

~~~html
<p>And now, we are going to <strong>klipsify</strong> this code snippet:</p>

<pre><code class="language-klipse-eval-php">print "Hello". " World!";
</code></pre>
~~~


# Live demo

Before dealing about integration of the klipse plugin on a web page, let's enjoy another `PHP` klipse snippet for string interpolation:

~~~klipse-eval-php
$snippet="klipse";
print "Hello $snippet";
~~~

Go ahead! modify the klipse snippet above, and it will evaluate as you type...

# Evaluating a gist

We can also evaluate code from a `gist`.

For instance, let's klipsify [this gist](https://gist.github.com/viebel/0f0934176da071ce4d9b8f488f246f24) that demonstrates basic class usage in `PHP`:

<pre>
<div class="language-klipse-eval-php" data-gist-id="viebel/0f0934176da071ce4d9b8f488f246f24"></div>
</pre>

Again, enjoy the interactivity and modify the code...

# Klipse plugin integration

All you need to do in order to integrate the klipse plugin to your blog (or any other web page), is to add this `javascript` tag to your web page, at the end of the body:

~~~html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://app.klipse.tech/css/codemirror.css">

<script>
    window.klipse_settings = {
        selector_eval_php: '.language-klipse-eval-php', // css selector for the html elements you want to klipsify
    };
</script>
<script src="https://asmblah.github.io/uniter/dist/uniter.js"></script>
<script src="http://app.klipse.tech/plugin_prod/js/klipse_plugin.min.js"></script>
~~~

By the way, this is exactly what we did on the page that you are currently reading.

# Limitations

`PHP` code evaluation in the browser with `Uniter` is in alpha stage, and currently only supports a small subset of `PHP`'s features. Here is the [list of the supported features of PHP](https://github.com/asmblah/uniter#features).



# Other languages

The klipse plugin is designed as a platform that could support any language that has a client-side evaluator, by writing modules to the klipse plugin. Currently, there are modules available for the following languages:
