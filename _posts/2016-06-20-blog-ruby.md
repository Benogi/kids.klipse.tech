This blog post is about to show a new way of blogging about `ruby`.

Look at a typical blog post about `ruby`: The post usually presents a couple of code snippets. As I see it, there are two pains with code snippets:

1. they contain the input and the output but not the actual evaluation of the input
2. it's impossible for the reader to modify the output

# The forgotten dream

A long time ago, all the developers had a common dream. The dream was about interactivity, liveness, evaluation...

But we put this dream aside - because the browser understands only `javascript`.

And after a while, we even forgot that we ever had this dream.


Still, there are some people that didn't forget this dream, like Alan Kay:

>Question: Well, look at Wikipedia â€” it's a tremendous collaboration.

>Alan Kay: It is, but go to the article on [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)), can you write and execute Logo programs? Are there examples? No. The Wikipedia people didn't even imagine that, in spite of the fact that they're on a computer.

Here is the [full interview of Alan Kay](http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/interview-with-alan-kay/240003442?pgno=2){:target="_blank"}. (Thanks [@fasihsignal](https://twitter.com/fasihsignal) for bringing this quote to our awareness.)

# The klipse plugin

The klipse plugin is a small step toward this dream: it is a `javascript` tag that transforms static `ruby` code snippets of an html page to live and interactive snippets:

1. **Live**: The code is executed in your browser
2. **Interactive**: You can modify the code and it is evaluated as you type

[Klipse](https://github.com/viebel/klipse) is written in `clojurescript`, it uses [Opal](http://opalrb.org/) for `ruby` code evaluation and [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) for text editing. 


# Klipsify a ruby code snippet

Let's have on this page a static code snippet with `[1,2] * 10`:

~~~ruby
[1,2] * 10
#1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2
~~~

(This blog is written with `jekyll`: the `kramdown` plugin helps a lot in beautifying the code snippets.)

And now, we are going to **klipsify** this code snippet:

~~~klipse-eval-ruby
[1,2] * 10
~~~

Feel free to edit the code above: it's interactive => it evaluates as you type.

All I had to do in order to **klipsify** my code snippet, was to set the `language-klipse-eval-ruby` class (configurable) to the appropriate html element.

See it by yourself: here is the source of this page:

~~~html
<p>And now, we are going to <strong>klipsify</strong> this code snippet:</p>

<pre><code class="language-klipse-eval-ruby">[1,2] * 10
</code></pre>
~~~


# Live demo

Before dealing about integration of the klipse plugin on a web page, let's enjoy another klipse snippet for an `Hello World` in ruby:

~~~klipse-eval-ruby
def hi(name)
"Hello #{name}"
end

hi "Klipse"
~~~

Go ahead! modify the code snippet above, and it will evaluate as you type...

# Evaluating a gist

We can also evaluate code from a `gist`.


For instance, we could evaluate [this gist](https://gist.github.com/viebel/62d62220da0507860102c8ca6ad6db86) that returns the multiplication table until `12`, like this:

<pre>
<div class="language-klipse-eval-ruby" data-gist-id="viebel/62d62220da0507860102c8ca6ad6db86"></div>
</pre>

Again, feel free to modify the code...

# Integration

All you need to do in order to integrate the klipse plugin to your blog (or any other web page), is to add this `javascript` tag to your web page:

~~~html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://app.klipse.tech/css/codemirror.css">

<script>
    window.klipse_settings = {
        selector_eval_ruby: '.language-klipse-eval-ruby', // css selector for the html elements you want to klipsify
    };
</script>
<script src="http://cdn.opalrb.org/opal/current/opal.min.js"></script>
<script src="http://cdn.opalrb.org/opal/current/opal-parser.min.js"></script>
<script src="http://app.klipse.tech/plugin_prod/js/klipse_plugin.min.js"></script>
~~~

By the way, this is exactly what we did on the page that you are currently reading.

# Other languages

The klipse plugin is designed as a platform that could support any language that has a client-side evaluator, by writing modules to the klipse plugin. Currently, there are modules available for the following languages: 

- javascript: [A new way of blogging about javascript](http://blog.klipse.tech/javascript/2016/06/20/blog-javascript.html)

- clojure[script]: [How to klipsify a clojure[script] blog post](http://blog.klipse.tech/clojure/2016/06/07/klipse-plugin-tuto.html)
